# JKWS Regenerate Image Meta Data
WordPress plugin that fixes images that lost their meta data.

Thanks to https://github.com/bomsn I found the code snippet to fix image metadata on https://alikhallad.com/how-to-restore-regenerate-missing-attachment-metadata-in-wordpress/

I used it to create a simple plugin that saved a client a lot of work after a crashed wp_postmeta table and restoring an incomplete backup.
This will be good to save for later and maybe extend a bit to make the usage more friendly.
